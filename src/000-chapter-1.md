# First Chapter Title Here

Replace this text with the content of your first chapter.
(It doesn't have to be the first, strictly speaking, but it'll be easier that way.)
To add additional chapters, add more `.md` files in this directory.
They will be added to the book in lexicographic order,
which is why they are prefixed with numbers.

If you prefer, instead of editing this file, you can delete it and make a new one.
